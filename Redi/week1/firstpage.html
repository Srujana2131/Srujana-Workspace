    <li class="special"><h2> Chicken curry</h2>
    <p>Delicious creamy butter chicken - made without marinade, so the dish can be finished in just 30-40 minutes.
         Lots of flavor from hot spices from Indian cuisine, and a perfectly creamy result that doesn't crumble.
        I've made this round with a bit of mild chilli - it tingles the tongue a bit, but in just the right way.
         You can spice it up or down yourself, 
         but personally I think that butter chicken should be creamy and round in taste and not too strong.</p>

    <li><h2>gulab jamun</h2>
    <p>It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. 
        Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya.
         It is often garnished with dried nuts, such as almonds and cashews, to enhance flavour.</p>
